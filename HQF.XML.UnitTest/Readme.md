##Intruduce
The project maybe is not good idea.but the System.XML source all not full open yet. so I add some unitTest to demostrate XMLDocument(System.XML) & XDocument(System.XML.Linq)


##Advice
`XMLDocument` is old class and it's for compatible for old project.In the feature you should condsider using `XDcoument` first instead of `XMLDocument`.

All New devices's SDK is not support `XMLDocument` yet.such as `Xbox 360`,`WindowPhone` etc.
